		<main>
			<p>On the surface, we look back on the Victorian England with not much interest beyond the industrial revolution and British imperialism.</p>

			<p>But there are lessons that are lost from the monumental events and people that generalize history— lessons that are found in the Victorian living experience that shape my practice and my view of making (and therefore, my view of the world.)</p>

			<p><h3>Bio</h3></p>

			<p>Ingrid is a 20 year old aspiring communication designer and hobbyist illustrator currently studying at Parsons The New School for Design in New York City. She’s originally from Hong Kong, and misses the seven poodles at her family home dearly.</p>

			<p>In high school she worked on the HKIS Interact Annual Charity Fashion Show (in art direction and leadership to raise over 500 thousand HKD for charity every year) and more recently has interned for Curious Few and Malogic Holdings Ltd (both advertising and branding firms based in Hong Kong.) She would like to spend the next long school break brushing up on her Chinese and building up her portfolio.</p>

			<p>Besides reading too deeply into old stuff, she’s also into drawing, anime, graphic novels, stationery, and social justice, in no particular order.</p>
