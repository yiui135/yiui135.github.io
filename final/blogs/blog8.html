			<p>Racism, sexism, religious intolerance, and gender and sexual minority (GSM) discrimination continue to be hot topics, perhaps more than ever due to the multiplication of perspectives and the inflammation of these topics. There’s imagery that is created to show people who are different in negative and offensive lights, just like the political cartoons sparked by the 1851 Great Exhibition. But ultimately, beyond the retrospection and realization that relative to the present, the past will always feel backwards and prejudiced, I’m encouraged by the existence of this kind of social commentary, even as biased as it might be.</p>

			<p>Because while these political cartoons prove the presence of controversy and xenophobia in response to the Great Exhibition, what do we generally see of the Great Exhibition now, over a century and a half later? We see its positive points, that it encouraged foreign trade and was a success that effectively widened the perspectives of the British public.</p>

			<p>A century and a half is a long time, and we certainly haven’t forgotten the negative points of the exhibition (as proven by my bringing these political comics up) but it’s more apparent to me than ever that, while history is mainly written from a positive viewpoint, there is the opportunity to affect the present and the future through documentation of the varying and often opposing viewpoints of every issue. There are definitely instances where it feels as though humans have learned nothing from history, especially considering the recent rise of xenophobia (including islamophobia and anti-semitism) in America in response to the 2016 Presidential Election. But that doesn’t mean that there’s no hope, that no general good can arise from the spoils of whatever the rest of the next four years will bring, and it’s going to be important to write, draw, sing, and record every last detail.</p>
