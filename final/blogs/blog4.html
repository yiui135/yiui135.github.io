			<p>In a world built on capitalism that very much propagated due to industrialization, it’s near impossible to escape the reach of mass-manufactured goods, and businesses often forget human wellbeing and decency in order to achieve higher returns.</p>

			<p>Victorians, in the face of looser food regulations, even adulterated flour with substances like brick dust and alum (a slow to act neurotoxin) in order to turn a profit and dodge high wheat flour prices. </p>

			<p>Modern manufacturing practices, thankfully, are generally more conscientious, but this doesn’t change the fact that machines, though they served as a relief for entrepreneurial Victorian bakers, are now often used to exploit workers simply because the machinery makes jobs quicker and easier. And in a world of higher demand at lower prices, that’s become commonplace. Even in creative industries, professionals constantly work overtime in order to fulfill orders and often are expected to without overtime pay. </p>

			<p>There’s no question that technology aids work and helps increase productivity, but when increased productivity becomes the norm and is expected of employees, is it not also an evil? Maybe not evil in the strong sense of an evil, but in the sense that it detriments people. The twining of technology with our lives is now irreversible, so where can a line for technology be drawn that stops it from harming the livelihoods of people, and how can employers be swayed towards this direction?</p>
