			<p>What we know of history is what has been told to us; and most often, this is through the writings of scholars and historians as well as the history textbooks we encounter in general schooling. But the fact that the British people looked down on people of different ethnicities or skin colors doesn't mean that British society was devoid of ethnically different people.</p>

			<p>In modern times so fraught with explicit racism, sexism, and religious discrimination, the world from decades ago may seem much simpler, when cities like London seemed more uniform and mono-cultured. But Victorian London, in fact, was home to many people of color, especially considering Britain’s then international empire and former participation in slave trade. This fact is seldom reflected in general curriculums because history was often not recorded by people of color, and people of color occupied lower classes in society.</p>

			<p>This bias in documentation aids the percolation of internalized xenophobia through to the modern day; by learning from a history dominated by White European accounts who themselves have biases, people gain an understanding of historical society and events through those authors’ views.</p>

			<p>In exploring this topic, it’s my aim to impart the sense of perspective that I gained from learning about it; that while, relative to the present, our historical predecessors seem much more bigoted than modern people, it is only in retrospect that we realize that bigotry. A person learning about the 2000s-2010s twenty years or even centuries in the future (hopefully human civilization hasn’t perished from environmental wreckage or nuclear apocalypse by that point) would probably look back and view what we consider to be the latest and greatest in unbiased ideology as antiquated. This is presuming, of course, that something is done to push the future of the world and its people towards a utopian vision, but considering the progress of many first-world societies in the past few decades, that seems to be the direction we’re moving in.</p>
