						<h2>Main Street</h2>
						<h3>Dublin, Ireland (1899)</h3>

						<hr class="small">

						<p><i>At first glance, this looked like many of our other Main Street photos, but what did Robert French (almost certainly) capture for us but a Barrel Piano on Main Street, Bandon in Co. Cork! At least I think that's what it is in the bottom right corner? Oh, and there're also a few women in those amazing hooded cloaks!</i></p>

					<h2>My Dear Sir...</h2>&nbsp;
					<h3>Oscar Wildeâ€™s 1890 letter to an Oxford student on the uselessness of art</h3>
					&nbsp;
					<div class="quote">
						<p>"Art is useless because its aim is simply to create a mood. It is not meant to instruct, or to influence action in any way. It is superbly sterile, and the note of its pleasure is sterility. If the contemplation of a work of art is followed by activity of any kind, the work is either of a very second-rate order, or the spectator has failed to realise the complete artistic impression.</p>
						<br>
						<p>A work of art is useless as a flower is useless. A flower blossoms for its own joy. We gain a moment of joy by looking at it. That is all that is to be said about our relations to flowers. Of course man may sell the flower, and so make it useful to him, but this has nothing to do with the flower. It is not part of its essence. It is accidental. It is a misuse. All this is I fear very obscure. But the subject is a long one.</p>
						<br>
						<p>Truly yours,</p>
						<br>
						<p>Oscar Wilde"</p>
