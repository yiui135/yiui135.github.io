							<p>A coy card reading “May I. C. U. Home?” could be easily slipped into a young woman’s palm, while a much more direct one stating the bearer was “Not Married and Out for A Good Time” would avoid any confusion that might arise during more traditional courtship. In Victorian-era America, most high society ladies’ interactions were governed by strict rules and watched closely by chaperones any time they were out of the house. Under this kind of scrutiny, it was nearly impossible for eligible bachelors and single ladies to meet without a formal introduction by a mutual acquaintance, unless they committed a major social faux pas by speaking to each other directly. So in order to get around these strict conventions, some turned to sneaking these flirtation cards (also known as “acquaintance” or “escort” cards) into the hands of the people they fancied, says Little. -<a href="http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/instead-cheesy-pickup-lines-19th-century-americans-gave-out-calling-cards-180957743/#VHgbF3yzloQHTIDV.99">Source</a></p>

							<h2>Lonely Hearts Ads</h2>
							<h3>The Allusionist: WLTM Part 1</h3>

							<p>As soon as one got the first newspapers and magazines, one got the first lonely hearts ads. They all emerged together. In the 1690s in London, suddenly the streets were full of newspapers and magazines; print really took off in a big way.</p>- Francesca Beauman</p></div>

							<h2>My Dear Sir...</h2>&nbsp;
							<h3>Oscar Wilde’s 1890 letter to an Oxford student on the uselessness of art</h3>
							&nbsp;
							<div class="quote">
							<p>"Art is useless because its aim is simply to create a mood. It is not meant to instruct, or to influence action in any way. It is superbly sterile, and the note of its pleasure is sterility. If the contemplation of a work of art is followed by activity of any kind, the work is either of a very second-rate order, or the spectator has failed to realise the complete artistic impression.</p>
							<br>
							<p>A work of art is useless as a flower is useless. A flower blossoms for its own joy. We gain a moment of joy by looking at it. That is all that is to be said about our relations to flowers. Of course man may sell the flower, and so make it useful to him, but this has nothing to do with the flower. It is not part of its essence. It is accidental. It is a misuse. All this is I fear very obscure. But the subject is a long one.</p>
							<br>
							<p>Truly yours,</p>
							<br>
							<p>Oscar Wilde"</p>
