		<h1>Industrialization and the Victorian Baker</h1>
		<hr>
		<main>
			<p>Industrialization, perhaps the biggest contribution to human advancement of technology since the beginning of time, was a contribution made by the Victorians.</p>

			<p>It’s what gave us the steam engine and enabled travel across great distances and faster, better, mechanized ways of doing just about everything. With efficiency on the rise, more could be created and transported than ever before — we, in the modern age, have those early technological innovations to thank for the machines we rely on for almost every aspect of our lives.</p>

			<p>Perhaps one of the most prominent distinctions between time before industrialization and after it is the means by which humans supply food.</p>

			<p>There are many food items whose names have not changed over time, but though their basic definitions may remain unchanged, the way they are produced has vastly changed.</p>
			
			<p>Bread is one such food item.</p>
			
			<p>Bread is an <i>option</i>, in our current day and age. It’s easy to avoid it if need be — there are other things to choose from, such as rice or pasta or other pulses and grains. But in the past, it was a relied on food source, delivered daily and constituting a majority of the day’s meals for all but the very wealthy.</p>
			 
			<p>But this bread, as important as it was, was not created using machinery or conveyor belt ovens as the soft white loaves in grocery stores are today. Bakers, believe it or not, once toiled over small wood-fired ovens and troughs full of dough in order to bring their communities their (literal) daily bread.</p>

			<p>This was a fact I didn’t fully acknowledge until watching the BBC Documentary series Victorian Bakers, in which four professional bakers experience baking through the lens of three different eras of Victorian Britain.</p>

			<p>The group is put through the wringer as they experience life as bakers in the countryside in the early 1800s, locked in a boiling hot basement in a mid-1800s London bakery, and brought into the familiarity of a late-Victorian bakery, each time discovering how the progression of their careers emerged.</p> 
			
			<p>What was surprising to them was the distinct lack of machinery even in the mid-1800s.</p>

			<p>In an age where people were flocking to the cities for industrial work involving new technologies and better pay, machinery was nowhere to be found in the bakery. Even though bread was just as essential as before, bakers suffered excruciating hours spent toiling over troughs, no kneading machines or temperature-controlled ovens in sight.</p>
