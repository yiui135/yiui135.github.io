		<h1>UX and Digital Literacy</h1>
		<h2>Week 2: 01.30.17-02.05.17</h2>
		
		</div>

		<p>After last week's exploration into digital literacy, I decided to take a closer look at User Experience design.</p>

		<p>Because the very point of UX design is to not only ease the experience of the user but also that of the designer/client, it's important for the make sure the communication between the client and the user is made clear.</p>

		<p>That realization made me start thinking about user expectations. It's a combination of what the user expects to see and what their preconcieved notions of the content that changes their interactions with a website.</p>

		<p>Take, for example, the website <a href="http://www.theuselessweb.com/"><i>The Useless Web</i></a> by Tim Holman. Users are brought to a screen that says nothing but the following:</p>

		<div align="center"><img src="media/uselessweb.png" alt="Useless Web" width="400"><h5><i>"Take me to a useless website please"</i></h5></div>

		<p>This creates an interesting relationship between the user's expectations and the content of Holman's website. Holman has the central button redirect to various sites that he deems "useless"— but in determining these as "useless websites," he must be thinking of the viewers of his website as well.</p>

		<p>Will the user be willing to click the button to get what allegedly will be a useless website? Will the user's knowledge and perception of "uselessness" align with the designer's? These are questions I asked myself when examining this site.</p>

		<p>What I drew from this analysis is that as much as there are expectations and preconceptions from both sides of a interactive piece— on the part of the creator and the viewer— there is a relationship of understanding that both parties trust in.</p>

		<p>It's this trust relationship that facilitates open dialogue between a piece and its viewer, and that determines the success of a website such as <i>The Useless Web.</i></p>
