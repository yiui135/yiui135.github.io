		<h1>Audience Driven</h1>
		<h2>Week 1: 01.23.17-01.27.17</h2>
		
		</div>

		<p>Using the keyword "audience-driven" to begin my search, I looked at the online form service <a href="https://www.typeform.com/">Typeform</a>, whose motto is "to make things a little more human."</p>

		<p>This motto pertains to their simple, intuitive approach to creation of surveys and forms that improves on preexisting form-creation services. Within Typeform's surveys, survey-takers are led through questions using a long scroll format form, each question isolated on a color blocked screen with various buttons or text input boxes for each field.</p>

		<p>From what I saw in typeform's design, I asked myself why its designers chose to make these decisions to guide the interaction of the form their way.</p>

		<p>I came to the conclusion that understanding of users' <u>preconcieved knowledge</u> is important for crafting a flow that suits the user and that serves the designer's or client's purpose.</p>

		<p>Because digital literacy has accelerated by leaps and bounds with every new generation of people and technology, different people of different age groups will have varying levels of digital literacy. An older user may have trouble understanding that blue colored hyperlinks link to other sites, just as younger users may no longer recognize floppy disks.</p>

		<p>It's the learned intuition that is intrinsic to digital literacy that I find intriguing.</p>
