			<h1>Frank Stella</h1>
			<hr align="left">
			<p>Frank Stella said, of his own minimalist practice, that "what you see is what you see-" and this is very true for much of his work. He's famous for his earlier geometric paintings, which are a departure from the abstraction and poeticism of others paintings of the 1950s and 1960s. His geometric paintings feature unique color combinations and concentric shapes on large canvases, but his newer works (from after the 1980s) are huge metal abstractions.</p>

			<p>The neatly painted sections of his paintings, in contrast to his sculptural work, are precise and straightforward, leaving no room for ambiguity or deeper meaning. He plays with monochromatic palettes as well as wildly varied palettes, and plays with geometric spirals and perpendicular lines.</p>

			<p>Their unabashedly graphic quality is what Stella is famed for, and his geometric work still resonates with people today.</p>
